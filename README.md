# Pulse-App-SQL-Based-User-Engagement-Analytics
This project simulates a product analytics use case for a consumer application, where SQL is used to analyze user engagement, retention, and growth trends. Using a relational dataset of users and login sessions, I answer real business questions such as identifying inactive users, measuring quarter-over-quarter growth, detecting power users, and validating data completeness. All insights are generated using pure SQL, demonstrating strong analytical thinking and job-ready querying skills.
